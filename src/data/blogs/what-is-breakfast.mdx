## The Morning Struggle Is Real

At 33, living alone in a foreign country, I've mastered Docker containers, deployed microservices, and debugged race conditions that would make senior engineers weep. But ask me to make breakfast? I'm suddenly a caveman staring at fire for the first time.

Every morning, I stand in my kitchen like I'm solving a complex algorithm: _How do I turn these raw ingredients into something edible before my first meeting?_

## The Cereal Trap

Let's be honest - cereal is the `console.log()` of breakfast. It works, it's quick, but you know you should be doing something better.

I've got three boxes of different cereals because I keep thinking variety will solve my breakfast crisis. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. Now I just have three ways to feel like a child eating sugar for breakfast.

**My cereal evolution:**

1. Healthy stuff that tastes like cardboard
2. Sugary stuff that makes me crash by 10 AM
3. "Adult" granola that costs more than my monthly Netflix subscription

## The Egg Equation

Eggs should be simple, right? Wrong. Eggs are the JavaScript of breakfast foods - deceptively complex with a million ways to mess them up.

**Scrambled eggs:** Either rubber or soup, no in-between
**Fried eggs:** Burnt bottom, raw top, every single time
**Boiled eggs:** I've set more timers for eggs than for production deployments

I've watched YouTube tutorials, read articles, asked my mom over video calls. Nothing works. My eggs remain a mystery wrapped in an enigma, served on a plate.

## The Toast Paradox

How is it possible to burn toast in a toaster? It's literally designed for one job. Yet here I am, scraping charcoal into the sink while my smoke alarm provides the morning soundtrack.

And don't get me started on avocado toast. By the time I figure out if the avocado is ripe, slice it without creating guacamole, and toast the bread to the perfect shade of golden brown, I could've written a small web application.

## Cultural Breakfast Confusion

Living in a foreign country adds another layer of complexity. The local breakfast foods look at me like I look at legacy code - intimidating and probably going to break something.

**Local grocery store conversations:**

- Me: "Where's the peanut butter?"
- Clerk: "The what now?"
- Me: _Dies inside_

Meanwhile, locals are casually preparing elaborate breakfast spreads that would take me three hours and a YouTube playlist to attempt.

## The Time Crunch Reality

Here's the thing about breakfast: it happens in the morning. And mornings are when my brain is still booting up, running on minimal RAM.

I've got exactly 23 minutes between waking up and my first Zoom call. In that time, I need to:

- Shower
- Get dressed
- Look human
- Consume nutrients
- Pretend I'm a functioning adult

Breakfast gets the leftover 4 minutes, which explains why I'm usually eating a banana while unmuting myself on calls.

## The Weekend Delusion

Weekends are when I convince myself I'll become a breakfast person. I'll buy fancy ingredients, watch cooking videos, maybe even meal prep.

Sunday night me makes grand plans. Monday morning me finds expired milk and stale bread, then orders coffee and a pastry from the place downstairs.

**Weekend breakfast shopping list:**

- Fresh herbs (will die unused)
- Fancy bread (will go moldy)
- Organic eggs (will expire)
- Good intentions (will evaporate by Tuesday)

## The Delivery Temptation

Food delivery apps know my weakness. They've got breakfast sections that mock my inability to crack an egg properly.

"Fresh croissants delivered in 20 minutes!" they whisper seductively.
"Gourmet breakfast bowls!" they promise.
"Why struggle when we can struggle for you?" they don't say but definitely imply.

My bank account reflects my breakfast failures more accurately than my kitchen does.

## The International Bachelor Breakfast Hierarchy

**Level 1:** Cereal and regret
**Level 2:** Toast (only slightly burnt)
**Level 3:** Instant oatmeal (feeling fancy)
**Level 4:** Scrambled eggs (50% success rate)
**Level 5:** Full breakfast (mythical, like unicorns)

I'm stuck somewhere between Level 2 and 3, with occasional Level 1 relapses during particularly rough mornings.

## The Real Solution

Maybe the problem isn't my cooking skills. Maybe it's expecting myself to be Gordon Ramsay before my first cup of coffee.

Perhaps breakfast doesn't need to be Instagram-worthy. Maybe it just needs to be fuel for the day ahead, consumed without setting off smoke alarms or questioning my life choices.

Or maybe I should just move closer to a good breakfast place.
